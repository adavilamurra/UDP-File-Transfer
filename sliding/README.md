# UDP File Transfer Protocol - Sliding Windows

We created a transfer protocol to send files using UDP. This is part 2 and corresponds to Sliding Windows.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project successfully you will have to run the server file (echoServer.py) located in the folder /server/ and then the client file (echoClient.py) located in the folder /client/.

### Prerequisites

To run this protocol you will need:
* Python 2.7
* Command Line Terminal

### Files Included

The following are all the files that are included in our Stop and Wait protocol.

```
client/
    file.txt        % small fille
    longFile.txt       % larger file
    echoClient.py    % client
    README.md       % more info about the client

    file.txt        % small fille
    longFile.txt       % larger file
