# UDP File Transfer Protocol - Stop and Wait

We created a transfer protocol to send files using UDP. This is part 1 and corresponds to Stop and Wait.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project successfully you will have to run the server file (udpServer.py) located in the folder /server/ and then the client file (udpClient.py) located in the folder /client/.

### Prerequisites

To run this protocol you will need:
* Python 2.7
* Command Line Terminal

### Files Included

The following are all the files that are included in our Stop and Wait protocol.

```
